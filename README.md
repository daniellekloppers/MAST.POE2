# Christoffel's Kitchen - Menu Management App

A mobile app for private chef Christoffel to manage his changing menu offerings.

## Features

- Create menu items with name, description, course selection, and price
- Choose from starter, main course, dessert, or drink
- View total menu item count
- Add all items to menu with one tap
- Form validation and smooth navigation

## Technical Details

- React Native with TypeScript
- React Navigation for screen management
- Cross-platform (iOS and Android)

## Current Status

The app code compiles with all features I implemented. Due to technical setup issues with the Android emulator on my virtual machine, I'm unable to demonstrate the live app running, but all functionality is present in the code.

All required features from Part 2 have been implemented including menu item creation, course selection, price handling, total count display, and add-all functionality.
